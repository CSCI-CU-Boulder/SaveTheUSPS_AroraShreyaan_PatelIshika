We constructed Binary Search Tree, Linked List and Hash-Tables from scratch in C++ to graph USPS package sifting run-time. Using graphed metrics, the Hash-Table and Linked List Chaining Collision Resolution presented 400% faster package sifting run-time.




                        --Work was equally/fairly divided, tested, and analyzed by both partners--

  //Task Mentions: Chronos + Binary Search Tree + Linked List + initial report formatting - Ishika 
  
  Hash Table (3 implimentations) + Chronos Integration (provided by: Ishika) and final report formatting - Shreyaan 
  
  Analyzation (after individidually graphing designated functions' results) also conducted collaboritively.
